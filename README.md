ann - Artificial Neural Networks in Go
======================================

Go (golang) implementations of various Neural Networks. 

* som.go is simple implementation of Self-Organizing Maps also known as Kohonen's maps.
* backprop.go is backpropagation training based neural network.

Check out demo.go for few examples on how networks can be used.

This is initial release. More various neural networks will follow.
